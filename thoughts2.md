Can we make the inputs just be in the source/dest boxes?

I like the simplified confirmation modal - it's cleaner, and keeps more context visible. you could leave the completed
comparison widget in view below it, and then you wouldn't need so much in the modal itself.

1: for now, let's scroll. I'd like to see what compression we can do later.
2: can we try switching to a horizontal layout on a narrower screen? main content on the top, activity panel on the
bottom.
3: purely chronological if on the bottom, grouped if on the right?
