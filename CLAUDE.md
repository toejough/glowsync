For every interaction we have:

1. Evaluate if any of the user agents should be used. Say YES or NO and explain why.
2. If any are YES, and the user is not already using one of those agents, suggest switching to that agent.

The user agents are POINTLESS if you don't actually evaluate their descriptions and use them for the purposes they were
intedended for.
